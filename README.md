# About

This is an example [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) page. You can [view the raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpl-makerlab/markdown-example/master/README.md) or edit this file directly in Github's built-in editor or your own code editor. Github automatically renders markdown files when viewing. Here's the [official markdown documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and [github-flavored markdown's documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (some slight differences). Usually HTML is allowed within Markdown, but on Github only certain tags are allowed. 

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.  - *[Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)*

Markdown syntax supports [hyperlinks](http://www.duckduckgo.com), *italics*, **bold** text, and lots more.

Code snippet
```

Pressing return twice at the end of a line will

create a new paragraph.

Adding two spaces at the end of a line  
acts as a simple line break.

Three asterisks creates a horizontal line tag.
***

Standard <b>HTML</b> formatting <b>is</b> also allowed within <i>Markdown</i>. Github-flavored Markdown does not support all HTML tags, however (i.e. iframe and script tags).
